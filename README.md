## 💩 **RBLX Ass Decompile Script**

> ⚠️ *use at ur own risk lol*

### ❗ What is this?

This is a **crappy Roblox decompile** script I slapped together in like 4 hours with zero care. It “works” – most of the time. Don’t expect miracles.
This is **NOT** a real decompiler. This is pain in code form.

### ⚠️ WARNINGS:

* 🧠 **Don’t ask me how it works. I barely know.**
* 🚫 **Don’t reupload. Don’t rename. Don’t touch.**
* 👮 **Don't cry when you get rate-limited, banned, or struck by Roblox karma.**
* 🧱 **Script breaks on anything mildly obfuscated. Good luck.**

### ✅ What it does:

* Scans some dumb local scripts.
* Dumps like half the info.
* Pretends it's useful.

### ❌ What it doesn’t do:

* Properly preserve metatables.
* Handle weird bytecode.
* Fix your life.

### 🛠️ Usage:

```lua
-- literally run this and hope for the best
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://your-sketchy-host.com/ass-decompile.lua"))()
```

### 📌 Rules:

* 🔒 **Don’t copy.**
* 🔁 **Don’t reupload.**
* 🧽 **Don’t “fix” and call it yours.**
* 🐀 **You do? You're a rat.**

### 🧾 License:

No license. You have no rights. Be grateful this even exists.

Let me know if you'd like a version that actually sounds professional or one for a real decompiler.
